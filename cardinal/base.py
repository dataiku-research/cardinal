    A query sampler can be seen as a clustering since it is most of the time
    an unsupervised approach sorting out samples to be annotated and those who
    should not.
    This is also considered a transformer for the sole purpose of chaining them.
    It is common in sampling to chain several approached. However, this can be
    easily dropped since it is more of a hack than a feature.
