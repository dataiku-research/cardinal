On the other hand, K-Means sampling explore the\nspace well but will probably fail at fine tuning our prediction model. In\nthat context, it seems reasonable to first explore the sample\nspace, say by using a KMeansSampler, and at some point shift to\nan exploitation mode where we fine tune our model using UncertaintySampler.\nWe define an Adaptive sampler that does exactly this.\n\nAs a heuristic, let us say that 5 samples per class should be enough\nexploration.

        "## Discussion\n\n### Accuracies\n\nIn all the figures above, the vertical red line indicates when the adaptive\nmethod switches from exploration to exploitation.\n\nWe first look at accuracy. As expected, KMeansSampler, a purely exploration\nmethod is the best at the beginning but becomes as performant as random\nwith time. Uncertainty sampling also behaves as expected by starting poorly and\nthen becoming the best method.\n\nOur AdaptiveQuerySampler combines the performance of both approaches to have the\nbest performance!\n\n### Contradictions\n\nContradictions measures how much, when trained on new samples, a model agrees with\nits past predictions. A perfectly stable model should have consistent predictions \ngiven new samples so we expect this measure to converge toward 0 over time. Looking \nat the red Random curve and the green Clustering, it seems like contradictions are\ninversely proportional to accuracy. However, we notice an interesting trend when\nthe adaptive model switches from exploration to exploitation. In fact, the number\nof contradictions seems to stall a bit and join the orange Uncertainty curve.\n\nThis effect is probably due to samples that are \"far\" from the training set. \nIf the Uncertainty focuses on a given region of the sample space, it is likely that\nthe samples far from those regions will be subject to more variability. By better\nexploring the space, KMeans sampling is less sensitive to these changes.\nIn the end, contradictions seems related to accuracy but contradictions weighted\nby exploration may be a better proxy for accuracy. This subject remains opened\nto further research.\n\n### Exploration Scores\n\nThe exploration curve also displays interesting trends. Since those are\ndistance, a good exploration method will have a low score. As expected,\nexploration-based methods have the lowest scores. In particular,\nKMeansSampler starts by decreasing and then goes up. At the same time, its\nperformance starts stalling. This shift happens incidentally at the same\ntime as our adaptive method shifts its method. This is obviously not random!\nThis exploration metric can be used to decide when to change method.\n\n"
