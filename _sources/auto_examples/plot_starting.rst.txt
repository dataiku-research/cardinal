Starting an Active Learning experiment
======================================

Each active learning experiment starts with zero labeled samples. In that
case, no supervised query strategy can be used. It is common to select the
first batch of samples at random however it is proposed in
`Diverse mini-batch Active Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05954>`_
to use a clustering approach for the first batch.
This example shows how to perform this.

The parameters of this experiment are:

* ``batch_size`` is the number of samples that will be annotated and added to
  the training set at each iteration,
* ``n_iter`` is the number of iterations in the simulation.

We use the digits dataset and a RandomForestClassifier.

Core Active Learning Experiment
-------------------------------

We now compare our class sampler to Zhdanov, a simpler KMeans approach and, 
of course, random. For each method, we measure the time spent at each iteration 
and we plot the accuracy depending on the size of the labeled pool but also time spent.

Discussion
----------

From this experiment on a subset of MNIST, we confirm the observation of the
original work: Selecting the first batch of samples using a K-Means sampler
increases the accuracy for the first few batches but does not improve the
final result, at least on this dataset and with the query strategies we
explore.
